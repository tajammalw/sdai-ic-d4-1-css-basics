# Basics of CSS Styling
Watch as your instructor demonstrates a few things that you'll practice right after the demo.

## Forking Repositories
When you fork a repo, there is a box checked by default to only copy the main branch. You will want to uncheck this box so that you get all the branches you need. 

If you forget to uncheck that box, you can still get access to the other branches you need. You'll need to follow the instructions from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch), taking special note of step 5 when you reach it.

## ToDo list âœ…
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

### Prepare Your Workspace

1. [ ] First, stop any other Codespaces you have running to conserve core hours.

### Create and Link a CSS File

2. [ ] Create a new CSS file named `styles.css` and link it to your HTML file by adding the following within the `<head>` element:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```

    Now, your `<head>` element should look like this:

    ```html
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My Simple Web Page</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```

### Change Paragraph Text Color

3. [x] Change the color of all paragraph text to blue by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    p {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```

### Set Background Color

4. [ x] Set a background color for the entire page by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    body {
        background-color: lightgray;
    }
    ```

### Adjust Heading Font Size

5. [ ] Increase the font size of the most important heading (h1) to make it more prominent by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
    }
    ```

### View Changes and Troubleshoot

6. [ ] View the changes made to the webpage and troubleshoot any mistakes. Use GitHub Copilot for suggestions and corrections if needed.

## That's it for the demo!
Now it's time to practice alongside your instructor as we all try coding in CSS together.
